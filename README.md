This is a software development work where I created a temperature converter that translates between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin using the Python programming language.
The user's input of Celsius is converted into two other temperature units, kelvin and farenheit, and vice versa if they enter Fahrenheit or Kelvin.
Additionally, I created a gui with Tkinter.

Additionally, I've attached a video that demonstrates how my task operates.
